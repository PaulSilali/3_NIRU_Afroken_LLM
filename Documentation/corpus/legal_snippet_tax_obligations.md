# Tax Obligations and Rights

The Income Tax Act requires all persons earning income in Kenya to register for tax, file returns, and pay taxes due. Taxpayers have the right to accurate information about their tax obligations and fair treatment by revenue authorities.

Taxpayers can appeal tax assessments and have the right to representation. KRA must provide clear information about tax requirements and processes. Late filing and payment attract penalties and interest as provided by law.

Tax information must be kept confidential except as required by law. Taxpayers have the right to privacy in their tax affairs.
