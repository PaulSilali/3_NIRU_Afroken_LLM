# Land Rights and Registration

The Land Registration Act requires all land transactions to be registered. Registration provides proof of ownership and protects land rights. Land owners have the right to use, transfer, and bequeath registered land.

Land searches verify ownership and encumbrances before transactions. All charges, mortgages, and restrictions must be registered to be legally effective. Land registration creates certainty and reduces disputes.

Citizens have the right to access land registration services and information about their land. Registration fees are prescribed by law and must be paid for services.
