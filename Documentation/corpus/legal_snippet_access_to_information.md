# Access to Information Act

The Access to Information Act 2016 grants citizens the right to access information held by public entities. Government agencies must provide information requested by citizens within 21 days, unless disclosure would harm national security or personal privacy.

Citizens can request information about government services, policies, and decisions affecting them. Public officers must assist citizens in making information requests and provide information in accessible formats.

Fees for information access must be reasonable and not create barriers to access. Information should be provided in official languages where possible.
