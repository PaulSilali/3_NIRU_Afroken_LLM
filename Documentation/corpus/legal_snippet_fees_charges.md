# Government Service Fees and Charges

Government service fees are prescribed by law and regulations. Public officers cannot charge fees beyond those authorized by law. Citizens have the right to know applicable fees before receiving services.

Fees must be reasonable and not create barriers to accessing essential services. Some services are free while others have prescribed charges. Fee schedules should be publicly displayed.

Citizens can request receipts for all payments made. Unauthorized charges or demands for bribes are illegal and should be reported to relevant authorities.
