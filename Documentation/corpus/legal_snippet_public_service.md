# Public Service Values and Principles

The Constitution requires public service to be based on values including high standards of professional ethics, efficient and effective use of resources, responsive and prompt service delivery, and accountability for administrative acts.

Public officers must serve citizens with integrity, respect, and professionalism. Services must be provided without discrimination, corruption, or favoritism. Citizens have the right to complain about poor service and receive redress.

Public service delivery should be citizen-centered, transparent, and focused on meeting citizen needs efficiently and effectively.
