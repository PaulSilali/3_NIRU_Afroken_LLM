# Data Protection Act Requirements

The Data Protection Act 2019 requires government agencies to process personal data lawfully, fairly, and transparently. Citizens have the right to know what data is collected, how it is used, and to access their personal data.

Government services must obtain consent before collecting personal information, use data only for specified purposes, and ensure data security. Citizens can request correction or deletion of inaccurate data.

Public officers handling citizen data must maintain confidentiality and only access information necessary for service delivery.
