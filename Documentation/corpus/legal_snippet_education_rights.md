# Right to Education

The Constitution guarantees the right to free and compulsory basic education. Government must take measures to ensure all children can access education regardless of background or ability to pay.

HELB provides loans to enable access to higher education. Eligible students have the right to apply for loans and bursaries. Education services must be accessible and of good quality.

Citizens have the right to education in official languages and can access education services without discrimination. Government must ensure education infrastructure and qualified teachers are available.
