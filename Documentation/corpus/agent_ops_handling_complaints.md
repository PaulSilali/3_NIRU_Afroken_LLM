# Handling Complaints and Feedback

## Complaint Handling Process

1. Listen actively: Acknowledge user's concern without defensiveness
2. Apologize appropriately: Express regret for poor experience
3. Gather details: Collect specific information about the issue
4. Provide solution: Offer resolution or next steps
5. Follow up: Ensure issue is resolved satisfactorily

## Types of Complaints

- Service delays: Acknowledge delay, provide timeline, offer alternatives
- Poor service quality: Apologize, escalate if needed, provide feedback channel
- Incorrect information: Correct information, apologize, provide accurate details
- System issues: Acknowledge technical problem, provide workaround, escalate to IT
- Billing disputes: Collect details, escalate to finance, provide reference number

## Response Templates

"I'm sorry to hear about your experience. Let me help resolve this. Can you provide [specific details]? I'll escalate this to [department] and you'll receive a response within [timeframe]."

## Feedback Collection

- Ask for feedback after resolving queries
- Use rating system (1-5 stars or helpful/not helpful)
