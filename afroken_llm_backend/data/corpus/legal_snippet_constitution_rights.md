# Constitutional Rights to Government Services

The Constitution of Kenya 2010 guarantees citizens the right to access public services. Article 43 establishes economic and social rights including the right to healthcare services, reasonable standards of sanitation, adequate housing, and education.

Citizens have the right to administrative action that is expeditious, efficient, lawful, reasonable, and procedurally fair as provided in Article 47. Public officers must provide services without discrimination and in a timely manner.

The Bill of Rights requires that state services be accessible to all citizens regardless of background, and that administrative processes be transparent and accountable.
