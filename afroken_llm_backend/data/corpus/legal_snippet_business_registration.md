# Business Registration Legal Requirements

The Companies Act requires all businesses operating in Kenya to register with the Business Registration Service. Registration provides legal recognition and enables businesses to operate legally, open bank accounts, and enter contracts.

Businesses must register for tax with KRA after business registration. Certain business types require additional licenses and permits from county governments and sector regulators.

Registration creates legal obligations including tax compliance, proper record keeping, and adherence to business laws. Failure to register can result in penalties and inability to operate legally.
