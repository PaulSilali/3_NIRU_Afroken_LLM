# Complaints and Redress Mechanisms

Citizens have the right to complain about poor government service and receive timely response. Public entities must have complaints mechanisms and respond to complaints within specified timeframes.

Complaints can be made to service providers, ombudsman offices, or relevant oversight bodies. Citizens have the right to appeal administrative decisions and seek review of unfair treatment.

Redress may include service correction, compensation, or disciplinary action against officers. Complaints processes must be accessible, transparent, and effective in resolving citizen grievances.
