# Agent Escalation Procedures

## When to Escalate

Escalate queries when:
- User requests human agent assistance
- Complex legal or policy questions beyond AI knowledge
- Complaints about government services requiring investigation
- Technical issues with government systems
- Sensitive personal matters requiring privacy
- Disputes requiring official resolution
- Emergency situations requiring immediate attention

## Escalation Process

1. Acknowledge user request politely
2. Explain that query is being escalated to human agent
3. Collect essential information: service type, issue summary, contact details
4. Create escalation ticket with reference number
5. Provide ticket number to user
6. Inform user of expected response time (typically 24-48 hours)
7. Transfer to human agent queue

## Information to Collect

- User name and contact information
- Service or department involved

- Any reference numbers or application IDs
- Timeline of events
- Desired resolution

## Response Templates

"Thank you for your query. This matter requires human assistance. I'm escalating your case to our support team. Your reference number is [REF]. You will receive a response within 24-48 hours."
