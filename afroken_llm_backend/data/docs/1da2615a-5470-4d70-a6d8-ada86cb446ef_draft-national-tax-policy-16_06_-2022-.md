economic development. 
We are operating in the dispensation of drastic shortfalls and decline of revenue over the years. In 
order to cure the revenue gap , a robust domestic resource mobilizat ion agenda is critical. In this 
regard, the development of this Policy is necessitated by the need to grow the tax revenue, provide 
legal framework for introducing tax incentives, provide guidance, ensure certainty, establish 
coherence in light of any futu re amendments to national tax law and many others. 
This Policy was developed in a consultative and participatory manner in line with the constitutional 
requirements of public participation and stakeholder engagement. I sincerely thank everyone who 
contrib uted to its developmen t and subsequent finalization. I n particular, I would like to thank the 
Tax Policy Working Group comprising of Officers from the National Treasury and Kenya Revenue 
Authority who have been part of the process from the beginning and de veloped the initial draft.

 Executive Summary 
The National Tax Policy is providing the framework within which tax related laws, regulations 
and rules are formulated and implemented. In realization of the need to rebuild the economy and 
the demands o f the changing business environment the tax policy has become a necessary tool. 
Unique challenges such as expanding the taxation to the hard-to-tax sectors (agriculture and 
informal sector), increased online businesses and globalization requires a framework to guide t he 
process . 
This document provides broader perspectives of taxation in Kenya; existing legal and regulatory 
framework, challenges and policy guidelines. It articulates the principles governing tax 
administration and revenue collection in Kenya. Thus, it provides guidelines for tax legislation, 
review, development and tax administration. Specifically, the document provides in -depth 
understanding of the income tax, Value Added Tax, Excise Tax, Import Duty and customs related 
taxes. 
The K enya’s tax system suffers numerous challenges leading to underperformance in revenue 
collection. For instance, Kenya’s revenue yield is still below the desired East African Community 
target of 25 percent of GDP required for EAC Monetary Union despite the h eavy investment by 
the G overnment to transform the tax system. In particular, ordinary revenue as a percentage of 
GDP has generally been declining over the last ten years from a high of 18.2 percent in the FY 
2013/14 to 13.8 percent in the FY 2020/21. This trend highlights the underlying issues affecting 
the tax system. 
Issues identified to significantly affect the tax collection include: a growing tax expenditure 
estimated 2.9% of the GDP as of 2020; complexities in taxation of emerging economies such as 
online businesses, international tax disputes and dispute resolutions; and low tax compliance 
among taxpayers. Th e Policy provides specific recommendation to address each of the identified 
challenges. To address unpredictability of tax rates, the Policy re commends that the tax law shall 
be reviewed once every five years. Further, there shall be guidelines for identification, 
implementation and administration of tax incentives. To address international taxation and treaties, 
the policy recommends to put in p lace mechanisms to facilitate smooth exchange of information 
while also putting in place rules to deter profit shifting and base erosion. The Policy also provides 
 
viii 
 policy recommendation based on specific issues affecting specific tax heads, which include in come 
tax, VAT, Excise, and customs duties. 
Further, the tax policy provides and implementation matrix and a monitoring evaluation 
framework. Key stakeholders identified in the implementation include The National Treasury, the 
National Assem bly, the Judiciary, the Attorney General, County Government and MDAs 
(Ministry, Departments and Agencies). The policy will also be monitored and evaluated based on 
a broad list of indicators to measure the success of the policy.

 Chapter One: Introduction 
1.1 Introduction 
This Policy sets out broad parameters on tax policy and other tax related matters. It articulates the 
principles governing tax administration and revenue collection in Kenya . Thus, it provides a set of 
guidelines that regulate taxation and forms the basis for tax legislation , review, development and 
administration . It is a vital tool for revenue mobilization to facilitat e social and economic 
development. 
1.2 Background 
Kenya’s pre-independence tax system was characterized by a narrow tax base comprising of taxes 
such as hut tax, land tax and poll tax which were regressive in nature. After independence, the 
Government embarked on modernization of the tax system through enactment of modern tax laws 
such as income tax, sales tax, excise duty and custom s duty . In the 1960s and early 1970s , tax 
policies and laws were common across the East African Community (EAC), which consisted of 
Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. After the disintegration of the Community in 1977 , each Partner 
State continued to use the same tax laws which they modified with time to reflect their unique 
situations. 
1.2.1 Income Tax Act 
The Income Tax Act was first enacted by the colonial administration in the year 1921 as an Income 
Tax Ordinance with major revisions in 1954. The current Income Tax Act, was enacted in 1973 
and came into effect in January 1974. The Act has been amended severally to align with the 
changing operating environment and international best practice. 
1.2.2 Sales Tax 
Due to the need to generate more revenue locally to finance the Budget, Kenya introduced sales 
tax in 1973 by enact ing the Sales Tax Act in 1973 . The general rate of the tax was at 10% and was 
applicable on goods manufactured in Kenya by registered manufacturers or goods imported into 
Kenya . The m anufacturers of the goods that were subject to the sales tax were required to be 
registered by the Commissioner. In addition to the general rate of tax, some few good s were subject 
to specific rate of tax. 

 The tax base of the sales tax was narrow as it was charged at the manufacturers level or at the point 
of importation only. The tax had a huge negative impact on the local manufacturing since the 
manufacturers of the goods that were subject to the sales tax were not allowed to deduct the input 
tax, hence increasing the cost of goods . 
1.2.3 Transition from Sales Tax to Value Added Tax 
The sales tax was replaced by the Value Added Tax (VAT) in 1990 . The transition from sales tax 
to VAT was informed by the fact that the former legislation was retrogressive and had negative 
impact on businesses because it did not provide for deduction of input tax , unlike VAT where the 
supplies of vatable goods or services deduct the tax paid on input supplies from the tax paid on out 
supplies and pay the net to the Kenya Revenue Authority , (KRA) . In addition, sales tax was being 
charged on goods only , whether locally manufactured or imported while VAT widened the scope 
by including services. At the time of enactment, VAT was considered a progressive tax and major 
source of revenue for the Government . It was anticipated that the revenue collected from this tax 
would surpass revenues from other tax heads such as i ncome tax, excise duty and import duty. 
However, as a proportion of the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ), VAT has continued to yield less 
revenue than income tax . 
The VAT Act (Cap. 476) underwent a major review in 2013 leading to a new structural design. 
The rationale for the new VAT Act was to modernize the law, rationalize/reduce zero-rating and 
exemption of goods which had increased over time . The review was aimed at increasing the 
revenue raised from the VAT through minimizing tax expenditure as well as aligning it with 
international best practice s. However, follow ing the enactment , some goods and services that were 
removed from the exemption Schedule and zero-rated Schedules s tarted to be re-introduced 
progressively thereby creating uncertainty i n terms tax policy . 
1.2.4 Excise Duty 
Prior to Kenya joining the East African Community Customs Union in 2004, Customs and Excise 
Duties were administered under one law, the Customs and Excise Act , Cap. 472 . The East African 
Community Customs Management Act (EACCMA) , 2004 was enacted by the East African 
Community Legislative Assembly to provide a legal framework to administer custom s matters. 
However, excise matters continued to be ad ministered under the Customs and Excise Act on 
transitional basis until 2015 when the Excise Duty Act, 2015 came into force. 

 Therefore, the main objective of enacting an Excise Duty Act was to have separate provisions on 
excise duty matters from Customs since Customs matter s were taken care of by enactment of the 
East African Community Customs Management Act, 2004 . In addition, there was need to 
modernize the Excise Duty provisions. 
1.3 Objectives of the National Tax Policy 
The overall objective of this Policy is to guide the progressive development and administration of 
Kenya ’s tax system . The specific objective s include: 
i. To offer policy guidance on the collection, enforcement and administration of tax es; 
ii. Provide the basis for review and development of tax laws; 
iii. Provide guideline s to stakeholders including investors on tax policy matters; 
iv. Provide gu iding principles for the Kenyan tax system; and 
v. Provide a legal framework for granting tax incentives and concessions to various sectors 
of the economy. 
1.4 Rationale of the National Tax Policy 
To achieve the country’s development agenda , a robust domestic resource mobilization agenda is 
critical . In this regard, the development of this Policy is necessitated by the need to : 
i. Grow the tax revenue . In an environment characteri zed with increased spending pressures 
and disproportionate growth in revenue as a ratio of GDP, there is need to undertake tax 
reforms within the confines of a National Tax Policy . This will protect and enhance 
domestic resource mobilization required to finance the Go vernment development agenda 
and reduce the country’s fiscal deficit. 
ii. Provide legal framework for introducing tax incentives. Over the years the G overnment 
has provided tax incentives and exemptions to support government programs and projects . 
Although the tax expenditures through tax incentives amounted to 2.96 percent of GDP in 
2020, which is comparable to the average of 2.9 percent for African co untries , there is need 
to have an effective tool for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of incentive 
regimes . This Policy is critical in guiding the management and monitoring of the tax 
incentives to safeguard the tax base and ensure value for mon ey. 

 iii. Provide guidance, ensure certainty and establish coherence in light of any future 
amendments to national tax law . Kenya’s tax policies are spread across various tax laws, 
which are amended every year during the national budget process. Frequent changes in tax 
laws cause unpredictability and inefficiency in tax administration . This creates distortions, 
which impose additional costs to taxpayers and the Revenue Administration . 
iv. Enhance structures for information gathering a nd sharing. Comprehensive 
information is important for tax collection, tax compliance and mitigation against tax 
avoidance and evasion. This policy provides guidelines for enhancing information 
gathering and sharing to support revenue mobilization and pro tect the tax base. 
v. Efficiently manage tax refunds. The tax refunds process is lengthy and constrained by 
inadequate information . The unpaid refunds withhold the working capital of the taxpayers 
thus imposing liquidity constraints on businesses. This policy provides guidelines for 
enhancing timely processing of tax refunds. 
vi. Address complexities in tax legislation and administration. There are complexities 
relating to tax administration and legislation which include; computation of tax liabilities , 
filing of tax returns and interpretation of tax laws. The se complexities affect the ease of 
doing business in the country. This policy p rovides guidelines to address complexities in 
tax legislation and administration. 
1.5 Guiding Principles 
This Policy is anchored on the following principles : 
i. Equity and fairness: everyone should pay a fair share of taxes. Equity can be categorized 
into two; h orizontal equit y where taxpayers in a similar financial condition pay equal 
amount in taxes and v ertical equity where taxpayers who earn higher income pay a greater 
share. 
ii. Simplicity, certainty and clarity: tax laws and administrative processes shall be simple, 
clear and easy to comprehend and interpret. 
iii. Administrative efficiency : the cost of compliance by ta xpayers and the administration 
cost to the Revenue Authority , shall be kept at a minimum level as much as possible. 

 iv. Flexibility: the tax system shall be dynamic and responsive to changing circumstances in 
the econom y. 
v. Sustainability: the tax system shall attract minimal changes over time, be coherent with 
other Government policies and support sustainable economic development. 
vi. Economic growth and efficiency: the tax system shall mitigate against distortions and 
expand the productive capacity of the econom y. 
vii. Transparency and accountability: the tax system shall enhance disclosure of information 
on revenues collected and expenditures. 
viii. Neutrality: the tax system shall minimize discrimination in favour of, or against, any 
particular economic choice. 

 Chapter Two: Situational Analysis 
2.1 Legal and Regulatory Framework 
Taxation in Kenya is anchored in Article 209 of the Constitution which empowers the National 
Government to impose Income Tax, Value -Added Tax, Excise Duty , Customs Duties and other 
duties on import s and export s, as well as any other tax which may be provided for through an Act 
of Parliament or County Assembly . The Article also empowers the County Governments to charge 
property rates, entertainment taxes and any other tax authorised by an Act o f Parliament. 
Additionally, both the National and County Governments are allowed to impose charges for the 
services they provide. 
Article 210 of the Constitution provides that taxes can only be imposed, waived or varied through 
an Act of Parliament. Furth er, Article 201 of the Constitution provides that the burden of taxation 
shall be shared fairly and the revenue raised nationally shall be shared equitably among National 
and County Governments. 
Further, Article 201 of the Constitution sets out the princi ples of public finance which tax laws, 
administrative processes and procedures are expected to be adhered to . In addition, t he Public 
Finance Management Act, 2012 prescribes the fiscal responsibility principles including a 
requirement for a reasonable degr ee of predictability with respect to the level of tax rates and tax 
base. 
Besides the Constitution and the Public Finance Management Act, 2012, (PFMA) there are tax 
laws and tax administ ration laws administered by the National Government . These include: 
a) The Income Tax Act, (Cap. 470): provides for ascertainment, assessment and collection of 
tax on income. This Act was enacted in 1973 and came into effect in January 1974. 
b) The Value Added Tax Act, 2013: provides for the imposition of value added tax on good s 
and services made in, or imported into Kenya. 
c) The Excise Duty Act, 2015: provides for the charge, assessment and collection of Excise 
Duty on excisable goods and services. 
d) The Tax Procedures Act, 2015: provides for harmonization and consolidation of pr ocedural 
rules for the administration of tax laws in Kenya. 

 e) The East African Community Customs Management Act, 2004: provides for the 
management and administration of Customs related matters in the EAC region . 
f) The Miscellaneous Fees and Levies Act , 2016: provides for the imposition of fees and 
levies on goods imported into the country for consumption in Kenya and export duties to 
encourage value addition on exports . 
g) Tax Appeals Tribunal Act , 201 3: provides for establishment of a tribunal for the 
management and administration of tax appeals. 
h) Kenya Revenue Authority Act , (Cap. 469) : provides for establishment of the Kenya 
Revenue Authority which is a central body for assessment and collection of revenue , for 
the administration and enforcement of the laws relating to revenue and to provide for 
connected purposes . 
2.2 Tax Administration 
The role of t ax administration in cludes management, direction and supervision of the 
implementation and application of tax laws and tax conventions to which Kenya is a party. Tax 
administration includes assessment, collection, enforcement, litigation, publication and statistical 
gathering functions under the various tax laws or conventions. 
2.2.1 Key Players in Tax Administration 
Tax administration involves KRA, the National Treasury , the National Assembly, the Judiciary 
and the Tax Appeals Tribunal. 
(a) Kenya Revenue Authority 
 KRA was established by Kenya Revenue Authority Act , Cap. 469 of the laws of Kenya, which 
became effective on 1 st July 1995. The core functions o f KRA are: 
i. To assess, collect and account for all revenues in accordance with the written laws and the 
specified provisions of the written laws; 
ii. To advise on matters relating to the administration of, and collection of revenue under the 
written laws or the specified provisions of the written laws; 

 iii. To a dminister revenue aspects of the Acts listed in the 
First and Second Schedules of the KRA Act (Cap 469) and collects levies for various 
Government Agencies under the provision of various Acts ; and 
iv. To perfo rm such other functions in relation to revenue as the Cabinet Secretary responsible 
for matters relating to finance may direct. 
Whereas K RA is the princip al agency mandated to collect government revenue, County 
Governments and other national government age ncies also collect various fees and levies. 
(b) The National Treasury 
The National Treasury is responsible for national tax policy and overseeing tax collection and 
accounting of the tax collected by KRA. To achieve this mandate, the National Treasury proposes 
policy changes to tax laws to the National Assembly in form of Bills for enactment from time to 
time. 
(c) National Assembly 
The National Assembly enacts and oversees the administration of tax laws. 
(d) Judiciary 
The Judiciary facilitates settlement of tax disputes between KRA and the taxpayers . 
(e) Tax Appeals Tribunal 
The Tax Appeals Tribunal (TAT) hears and determines tax disputes between the Commissioner 
and taxpayers. 
2.2.3 Key Issues in Tax Administration 
i) Registration of Taxable Persons : 
Taxpayers are registered and issued with a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) to 
facilitate enforcement of tax laws. 
ii) Tax Compliance 
Ensuring tax compliance in areas of taxpayer registration, filing of returns, payment of taxes and 
reporting. The filing and payment compliance stood respectively at 68 percent and 88 percent, in 
the FY 2020/21. 

 iii) Staffing and Capacity Development 
Ensuring t here is continuous training and acquisition of new skills, equipment and technology by 
the revenue administration officers to enable them cop e with emerging issues in tax administration. 
iv) Tax refunds 
Ensur ing the tax refund process is clearly understood by revenue officers and is documented 
including lodgement of the refund claim , assessment, approval and payment. This is to minim ise 
revenue leakage . 
 
v) Collaboration with other Government Agencies and County Governments 
Ensuring there is effective and efficient collaboration with d ifferent Government agencies 
including National Government, County Governments and Ministries, Departments and Agencies 
(MDAs ) that facilitates collect ion of tax revenues , fees and levies at va rious levels . 
 
vi) Cost of Collection 
Ensuring there is a dministrative efficiency in collection of revenue so that the cost of revenue 
collection is kept at a minimum level. In order to maintain the cost of revenue collection at low 
levels , the Government has continued to invest in informatio n communication technolog y. 
vii) Dispute Resolution 
Ensuring t ax disputes are handled effectively and prudently and dispute resolution services are 
accessible by all taxpayers. Kenya has a graduated tax dispute resolution mechanism that is 
accessible to all taxpayers . The stages comprise of; 
i. Objections 
ii. Tax Appeals Tribunal 
iii. Appeals to the High Court 
iv. Appeals to the Court of Appeal 
v. Appeals to the Supreme Court 

 When an appeal is before the TAT or the courts, the taxpayer or Commissioner may voluntarily 
request fo r the dispute to be handled through an out of court or out of the Tax Appeals Tribunal as 
an alternative method of handling tax disputes . 
The Tax Procedures Act , 2015 provides that under the out of court settlement or out of Tax Appeals 
Tribunal , disputes should be resolved within 90 days. The average time taken to resolve cases 
reduced from 89 days in FY 2019/20 to 42 days in the FY 2020/21. In addition, 552 cases were 
resolved through the out of court which yielded Ksh. 31.4 billion in revenue. 
2.3 International Tax and Treaties 
Taxation of profits earned by Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) is complex as the entities operate 
in several tax jurisdiction around the world. Different tax jurisdictions impose different rules, but 
international standards have been developed to create consistency through bilateral or multilateral 
treaties. The treaties largely adopt international best principles and guidelines. 
As at 2021, Kenya ha d entered into fifteen Agreements on Avoidance of Double Taxation and 
Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital gains (DTA) with various 
countries. The agreements are help to eliminate double taxation, allocate taxing rights between the 
parties and reduce incidences of tax evasion through exchange of information. In addition, there 
are other agreements that have been concluded but are not in force yet. 
Kenya is a member of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for tax 
purpos es which works on the implementation of global transparency and exchange of information 
standards around the world. In addition, Kenya is party to the Multilateral Convention on Mutual 
Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MAC) which provides for all p ossible forms of 
administrative co -operation between states in the assessment and collection of taxes including 
exchange of information and the recovery of foreign tax claims. 
2.4 Tax Structure 
Taxes are categorized into direct and indirect taxes, and customs duties. Direct taxes are taxes on 
income of a person and the burden of the tax falls on th e person who earns the income . On the 
other hand, indirect taxes are taxes on consumption of good s and services and the burden of the 
tax falls on the consume r. Customs duties are charges made on imported or exported goods. Direct 

 taxes are currently the major sources of revenue to the Government followed by indirect taxes and 
custom s duties . 
2.4.1 Direct Taxes 
Income Tax 
Income tax is an annual tax charged on income of a person and corporate bodies whether resident 
or non -resident, which is accrued in or was derived from Kenya. Under the Kenyan income tax 
system as stipulated in the Income Tax Act (Cap. 470) , income includ es; business income, 
dividends and interests, employment income, royalties, rent al income , pension income, i ncome 
from a digital marketplace; natural resource income, leases, capital gains or income deemed to be 
income of a person among others. 
Income tax is classified into two major categories depending on whether it is from companies or 
individuals. These are: 
 
i. Corporat e Income Tax 
This is a form of income tax that is levied on corporate bodies such as limited companies, trusts, 
and co-operatives, on their annual income. Companies registered outside Kenya but operate or 
with branches in Kenya are subject to corporation income tax on income accrued in Kenya. Such 
entities are referred to as permanent establishments. Corporate income tax is paid in instalments 
on the 20th of the 4th, 6th, 9th and 12th month of a company's financial year. Any balance of tax at 
the end of the year must be paid within four months of the financial year end. 
ii. Personal Income Tax 
Personal Income Tax (PIT) is levied on the wages, salaries, dividends, interest, and other income 
earned by a person in gainful employment . Tax on wages and salaries is collected through pay as 
you earn. Companies, partnerships and individuals with liable employees are required to ded uct 
tax in accordance with the prevailing tax rates from their employees' salaries or wages on each 
payday for a month and remit the same to KRA on or before the 9th of the following month. Self -
employed individuals (partnerships and sole proprietorships) are required to account and pay taxes 
on the income derived or accrued in Kenya. 

 2.4.2 Indirect Taxes 
a) Value Added Tax (VAT) 
VAT is a consumption tax charged under the Value Added Tax Act, 2013 on supply of goods and 
services. The supplies are categorised into either zero-rated supplies, exempt supplies or standard 
rated supplies. The tax is charged on the value added at different stages of production and at 
different levels of the distribution of goods or services. 
The VAT Act requires that a person who in the course of business makes taxable supplies or 
expects to make taxable supplies whose value is five (5) million shillings or more within a period 
of twelve (12) months or is about to commence making taxable supplies whose value is expected 
to exceed five million shillings within a period of twelve months, shall be liable for registration 
and apply to th e commissioner for registration. 
Taxpayers are required to acc ount for the tax at the time of supply and file and make payment not 
later than the 20th day of the following month in which the supply occurred. However, for imported 
goods, tax is collected at the point of importation by the Commissioner of Customs and B order 
Control . 
VAT in Kenya is based on destination principle and therefore allows for zero rating of exports. 
Generally, all goods and services are vatable unless expressly provided for under the Act as exempt 
supplies. The objective of exempting certain supplies is to lower the cost s of essential goods and 
services or to promote certain investments. 
b) Excise Duty 
Excise duty is a consumption tax charged on excisable goods manufactured in Kenya by a licensed 
manufacturer, or excisable services supplied in Kenya, or on excisable goods imported into Kenya. 
Besides generating revenue, excise duties are also designed to address negative externalities 
associated with consumption of certain goods and services. However, exemption from excise duty 
applies to goods and services exported from Kenya or those specifically provided for in the Excise 
Duty Act. 
Excise duty is charged based on either specific rates or ad valorem rates to a narrow or selective 
base of goods and services. The tax period for which the excise duty must be reported and paid is 
the calendar month and the prescribed due date as provided for in the Excise Duty Act, 2015 . 

 However, for imported goods, excise duty is collected at the point of importation by the 
Commissioner of Customs Services. 
2.4.3 Customs Duty 
Customs Duty is a tax levied on either the importation or exportation of goods across international 
borders. Kenya as a member of the East Africa Customs Union, administers the EAC Customs 
Management Act , 2004 , EAC Common External Tariff (EACCET) and the EAC Rules of Origin. 
For collection of custom duties , the rules of international trade by way of Treaties, Conventions 
and Instruments of World Trade Organisation (WTO) and World Customs Organisation (WCO) 
to which Kenya is a signatory are considered. Kenya being a member of the EAC and COMESA, 
accord any goods confirmed to be imported from member countries of either entity preferential 
rates of import duty. 
Import duties are either computed as a percentage of the value of imports (ad valorem) or at a 
specific duty rate. The import duty rate structure is based on the general categorization of goods 
where raw ma terials and capital goods attract no duty, intermediate goods which attract a higher 
rate of duty and the finished goods which attract the highest rate of duty so as to discourage 
importation of such goods. There are some categories of goods which are cate gorised as sensitive . 
These goods attract high er rate than other goods. T hese goods are produced in the region hence 
the need to protect the m from competition from imported goods. 
In order to address shortage of foreign exchange which was res ulting from reduced exports, the 
Government in 1993, introduced an Export Processing Zones (EPZ), to promot e exports. The EPZ 
provide s tax incentive s for firms to produce goods for export . The incentives include a ten -year 
corporate tax holiday and a corpor ate of 25 percent thereafter, a ten-year withholding tax holiday 
on dividend, duty , excise duty, VAT , fees and levies are exemption on all goods imported into the 
EPZ, except motor vehicles . The firms operating in the EPZ also enjoyed favourable business 
regulatory procedures. 
Other schemes that were implemented for promotion export s include Manufacturing Under Bond 
(MUB) . Raw materials imported under th is scheme are not subject to import duty , VAT, excise 
duty, fees and levies . The la test s cheme on promot ion of export s is Special Economic Zones (SEZ) 
which provide for lower corporation tax rate, in addition to VAT, import duty, excise duty, fees 

 and levies exemption o n raw materials and inputs imported into the SEZ. The common factor on 
these Schemes is th at goods produced from these Schemes when sold into the domestic market, 
are subject all taxes, fees and levies j ust like any goods imported from a foreign territory. 
2.4.4 Other Charges on Imported Goods 
In addition to customs duty, imported goods may also attract fees or levies such as Railway 
Development Levy (RDL), Import Declaration Fee (IDF) among others. IDF and RDL are charged 
on all goods imported for home use . 
2.5 Revenue Performance 
i. Growth in Absolute Ordinary Revenue 
The Government has invested heavily in the transformation of the tax system through 
modernization of tax laws and automation of tax administration with a view to improving 
productivity of the tax regimes. This has led to a gradual rise in ordinary revenue, in absolute 
terms, from Ksh 682 billion in FY 2011/12 to Ksh 1. 56 5 trillion in FY 20 20/21. Despite the growth 
in absolute terms, the annual growth rate has been declining (Figure 1). 
Figure 1: Growth in Absolute Ordinary Revenue (Ksh Billion & Percentage) 
 
Income tax and Value Added Tax, which are the biggest contributors to the ordinary revenue grew 
from Ksh 312 billion and Ksh 176 billion to Ksh 694.1 billion and Ksh 410.8 billion respectively, 
over the same period (Table 1). 

 Table 1: Performance of Ordinary Revenue and its components (Ksh Million and 
Percentage) 
 
ii. Growth in Ordinary Revenue in Relation to Nominal GDP 
Despite the heavy investments by the Government to transform the tax system, Kenya’s revenue 
yield is still below the desired East African Community target of 25 percent of GDP. In particular, 
ordinary revenue as a percentage of GDP has generally been declining over the last ten years from 
a high of 18.2 percent in the FY 2013/14 t o 13.8 percent in the FY 20 20/21 (Figure 2). 
Figure 2: Performance of Ordinary Revenue in relation to GDP 
 
The declining trend in ordinary revenue to GDP ratio is as a result of a decline in specific tax heads 
with income tax declining from 7.9 percent of GDP in FY 2010/11 to 6. 1 percent in FY 20 20/21 ; 
Value Added Tax from 5.0 percent to 3.6 percent and Excise Duty from 2.3 percent to 1.9 percent

 of GDP over the same period. On the other hand, Import Duty averaged at around 1.2 percent of 
GDP over the 10 -year period (Figure 2). 
The average ordinary revenue as a percentage of GDP over the period FY 2010/11 to FY 20 20/21 
for Kenya was 1 6.4 percent (Table 2). Although this is higher than that of the other East African 
countries (Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi), which stands at 13. 7 percent , it is below the 
desired target of 25 percent . South Africa on average performed better than Kenya over the same 
period at 25. 8 percent of GDP.

iii. Tax Buoyancy 
Over the years, Kenya’s tax system has not been buoyant. In principle, annual growth in tax 
revenue should be more than the growth in nominal GDP. In some years, the growth in ordinary 
revenue has been lower than the growth in nominal GDP (See Figure 3 below ), implying that 
revenue growth has not been consistently responsive to growth in nominal GDP.

iv. Ordinary Revenue in Relation to Government Expenditure 
The ratio of ordinary revenue to total Government expenditure declined from 7 1.9 percent in FY 
2011/12 to 56.8 percent in FY 20 20/21 (Figure 4 below ). Over the same period, the ratio of 
ordinary revenue to total Government expenditure averaged at 6 4.3 percent . This implies that over 
35 percent of the total Government expenditure was financed through loans, grants and ministerial 
Appropriations -in-Aid.

v. Ordinary Revenue Performance in Relation to Set Targets 
Revenue collection has generally fallen short of the set targets (Figure 5). The deviation of actual 
revenue collection from the set targets increased over the 10 -year period to FY 20 20/21 , hence the 
need for Governmen t to borrow both internally and externally.

2.6 Challenges of Kenya ’s Tax System 
Significant progress has been made in transforming the tax system, however, there still exists 
challenges which impact on revenue performance. These challenges include: 
i. Existence of h ard to tax sectors 
The Kenyan economy is dominated by subsistence agriculture and a large informal sector , which 
are difficult and unecono mical to tax. Whereas the informal sector is expanding, its contribution 
to revenues remains low as it is largely cash based and characterised by poor record keeping. This 
has led to overreliance on the formal sector for tax revenue. 
ii. Tax incentives 
The tax laws provide for various tax incentives . These include ; tax exemptions, tax deductions, 
allowances, tax deferral and concessional tax rates or timing rules, such as accelerated depreciation 
of capital assets. Although, t he incentives are aimed at promoting investments and providing relief

Target Revenue Actual Collection

 to the low -income earners and vulnerable groups in the society , they erode the tax base and cause 
the Government to forego tax revenue estimated at 2.96 percent of GDP as of 20 20 compare d to 
2.9 percent average for African countries . This impacts negatively on revenue mobilisation and 
implementation of the nat ional development programmes 
iii) Low tax compliance 
The tax compliance in terms of filing tax returns and payment of tax, respectively stood at 68 
percent and 88 percent, in the FY 2020/21 . The levels of compliance are mainly attributed to the 
technical and complex nature of tax laws and procedures, taxpayer apathy, high compliance cost, 
inadequate sharing of taxpayer information among National and County Government agencies, 
lack of physical presence of KRA offices in some places, and inadequate taxpayer education 
program. These factors make it difficult for taxpayers to file returns and pay taxes due. 
iii. Complexity in taxing emerging digital economy 
The tax system is not fully equipped to deal with emerging technological business models. This 
has led to some business activities being left out of the tax net and especially the activities carried 
out through internet on a digital platform. These business activities can be carried out in a tax 
jurisdiction without having physical presence in that jurisdiction. 
iv. VAT 
i. High t ax expenditure – VAT tax expenditure is relatively high compared to the overall 
VAT collected . It is estimated at 2.2 percent of GDP in the year 2020 . 
ii. Multiple rates – In the year 2020 there are two general rates of VAT : 8 percent for 
petroleum products ,16 percent for other goods/services and 0 percent for exported goods . 
The rate on petroleum goods creates undue advantages over other goods . 
a. Excise duty 
High rates of excise duty : The rate of excise duty in Kenya is high compared with that of EAC 
Partner States which is considered to be contributing to increase in illicit trade through smuggling . 
v. Customs Administration 
Dynamics in international trade includ ing, emerging business models, new trading partners, 
increased security threats , organized crimes and increasing number of regional free trade areas that 

 Kenya is a member , present challenges in Customs administration . Specifically, Customs 
administration faces the following main challenges ; 
a) Inadequate modern technolog ical equipment for use at entry/e xit border points to address 
mis-declaration and misclassification of goods. ; 
b) Inadequate customs border posts which encourage infiltration of c ounterfeits, smuggling 
and diversion of goods ; 
c) Inadequate staff capacity and training ; 
d) Inadequate cooperation, coordination and collaboration among st Government agencies on 
customs and border management matters; and 
e) Inadequate customs -to-customs regional cooperation to curb abuse of rules of origin. 
vi. Tax administration 
i. Only a small number of persons issued with PIN pay taxes. 
ii. High number of unregistered taxpayer s. 
iii. Low tax morale due to inadequate tax-payer education and information ; 
iv. Inadequate preparedness to deal with emerging challenges ; 
v. Limited collaboration and information sharing between the National and County 
Governments on tax matters; 
 
vii. Dispute resolution 
Lack of independence of the (TAT) and out of Court or Tribunal tax dispute resolution p rocesses. 
Facilitators of dispute resolution in cases to be settled o ut of Court or Tribu nal are appointed by 
the Commissioner who is party to the dispute. 
viii. International Taxatio n and Tax Treaties 
There is significant presence of MNEs that derive income from Kenya and constitute a significant 
source of revenue for the Government. Increasing globalization has created opportunities for 
MNEs to engage in tax planning including arrangement of businesses to minimize global tax 
liabilities, often by shifting profits to low -tax jurisdictions and manipulation of tax residence status. 

 Most of the treaties that have been negotiated do not have provisions to address Base Erosion and 
Profit Shifting. Specificall y, tax treaties and international taxation are faced with the following 
main challenges : 
i. Lack of policy on avo idance of double taxation and fiscal eva sion to guide negotiations 
between Kenya and other tax jurisdictions ; 
ii. Some DTAs in force were concluded many years ago and hence not in line with the 
recent international best practice ; 
iii. Abuse of tax treaties by multinationals ; 
iv. Inadequate mechanism to address base erosion and profit shifting by MNEs ; 
v. Insufficient technical capacity on international taxation; and 
vi. Emerging and evolving business models that cannot be adequately addressed by 
existing taxation frameworks.
